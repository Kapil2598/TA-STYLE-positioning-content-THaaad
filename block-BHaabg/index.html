                            A statement of the luxury class: the BMW X7 is the elegant fusion of presence and personality. Despite its majestic appearance, it gives an impression of lightness and agility thanks to the puristic design and athletic styling. The considerable spaciousness of the interior offers a pioneering interplay of exclusivity, functionality and freedom. Charm is its essence. Elegance its character. "The BMW X7 not only adds a new top model to the X family, but also defines a progressive approach to luxury for the BMW brand."
